comment: "How to participate in the benchmark effort"
---

All those interested in phase field modeling are welcome to
participate in the effort and to join our discussions. We value all
forms of productive input. There are a number of ways to get involved:

<h4> Uploading Benchmark Results </h4>

The most significant way to contribute is by trying to implement the
[benchmark problems]({{ site.baseurl}}/#benchmarks) using one of the
[suggested codes]({{ site.baseurl}}/codes) or your own custom code and
then [uploading the
results]({{ site.baseurl }}/simulations/upload_form/)
to the website.

<h4> Chat </h4>

We have active discussion on the [Gitter chat
channel]({{ site.chat }}). Feel free to
ask questions there.

<h4> Chat Meetings </h4>

We hold monthly [chat meetings on
Gitter]({{ site.links.github }}/wiki#chat-meetings). Please
try and participate and either ask question or listen to the chat. The
content from [previous chat
meetings]({{ site.links.github }}/wiki#chat-meetings)
is available

<h4> Mailing List </h4>

Please subscribe to the [mailing list]({{ site.baseurl
}}/mailing_list/) to stay informed about upcoming chat meetings and
workshops or just to ask questions.

<h4> Via GitHub </h4>

Please feel free to [open an issue on
GitHub]({{ site.links.github }}/issues/new) if
you would like to raise an issue about one of [the benchmarks
problems]({{ site.baseurl }}/#benchmarks) or with anything at all
about the website.

<h4> Workshops </h4>

An integral component of {{ site.title }} is regular [workshops]({{
site.baseurl }}/workshops) and associated [hackathons]({{ site.baseurl
}}/hackathons). Approximately twice a year, a spectrum of United
States and international researchers, ranging from graduate students
to senior scientists, come together to participate. See the [workshops
page]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshops) for details about past workshops
and plans for future workshops.

<h4> Website Development </h4>

The development of this website is a community effort. Please see the
[development guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/DEVELOPMENT) if you would like
to help out.
